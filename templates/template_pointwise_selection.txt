**Instruction**:
You are a database expert, and you are given:
- Database schema , including table names, column definitions, and relationships and example data.
- A natural language question describing a query intent.
- A candidate SQL query and its execution result (first 10 rows) that attempts to answer the question.

Your task is to:
- Understand the question's requirements (including hints) and analyze the database schema
- Evaluate the correctness of the candidate SQL query:
1) Correctly select the required data  and avoid returning extra or irrelevant data,
2) The logic is sound, incorporating correct joins, appropriate filtering, and accurate groupings and aggregations where needed....
- Consider Edge Cases and Logic Issues: SQL should correctly handle NULLs and missing data, remove duplicates when necessary, and make sure numeric operations precise (e.g., avoiding integer division), and right SQL function (Sqlite)
- Validate execution result: The output of correct SQL should match the expected values as required by the NL question, besides, the number of rows and result rankings should also match the requirement.
- Based on the question and the database information provided, finally determine whether the candidate SQL is correct or incorrect by return True or False.


** Output Format: **
- Provide reasoning before you return your choice inside the <Thinking> and </Thinking> tags.
- At the end of your analysis, you must return True or False in <Answer> and </Answer> tags.

- Here is an example of the output format:
