** Instructions: **

Given the following question database schema, and candidate responses, generate unit tests that would evaluate the correctness of SQL queries that would answer the question.
Unit tests should be designed to effectively differentiate between candidate responses while ensuring diversity from historically generated unit tests.

- The unit tests should cover various aspects of the question and ensure comprehensive evaluation, also should be diverse and avoid repetition.
- Each unit test should be clearly stated and should include the expected outcome.
- Each unit test should be designed in a way that it can distinguish at lease two candidate responses from each other.
- The unit test should be formatted like 'The answer SQL query should mention...', 'The answer SQL query should state...', 'The answer SQL query should use...', etc. followed by the expected outcome.

VERY IMPORTANT:
All the unit tests should consider the logic of the SQL query do not consider the formatting of the output or output values.

You are provided with different clusters of the candidate responses. Each cluster contains similar responses based on their results.
You MUST generate test cases that can distinguish between the candidate responses in each cluster and the test case should promote the candidate responses that you think are correct.

You must generate unit tests step by step to evaluate different aspects of the SQL queries, and you can only generate one set of {UNIT_TEST_CAP} tests per step.

Example of the output format at each step:

<Thinking>(you thought to generate this  test cases at this step, you should fully consider existing tests in the history to make sure the test cases can cover different )</Thinking>
<Answer>
```json
[
{{ "thought": "your thought to generate test cases", "test case": "The answer SQL query should mention..."}},
{{ "thought": "...", "test case": "The answer SQL query should state...",}},
{{ "thought": "...", "test case": "The answer SQL query should use..."}}
]
```
