** Instructions: **

Given the following question database schema, and candidate responses, generate a set of {UNIT_TEST_CAP} unit tests that would evaluate the correctness of SQL queries that would answer the question.
Unit tests should be designed in a way that distinguish the candidate responses from each other.

- The unit tests should cover various aspects of the question and ensure comprehensive evaluation. 
- Each unit test should be clearly stated and should include the expected outcome.
- Each unit test should be designed in a way that it can distinguish at lease two candidate responses from each other.
- The unit test should be formatted like 'The answer SQL query should mention...', 'The answer SQL query should state...', 'The answer SQL query should use...', etc. followed by the expected outcome.


VERY IMPORTANT:
All the unit tests should consider the logic of the SQL query do not consider the formatting of the output or output values.

You are provided with different clusters of the candidate responses. Each cluster contains similar responses based on their results.
You MUST generate test cases that can distinguish between the candidate responses in each cluster and the test case should promote the candidate responses that you think are correct.


Example of the output format:
```json
[
{{"test case": "The answer SQL query should mention...", "thought": "This test case can... "}},
{{"test case": "The answer SQL query should state...", "thought": "..."}},
{{"test case": "The answer SQL query should use...", "thought": "..."}}
]
```
